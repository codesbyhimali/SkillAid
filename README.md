# **Skill Aid: Empowering Students through SDG 17**

## **Overview**
**Skill Aid** is a full-stack Django application designed to bridge the gap between students and professionals. The platform enables students to register based on their skills as mentees or volunteers, while mentors—businesspeople, entrepreneurs, or professionals—can hire them for specific events. Students gain real-world experience and earn academic credits for their participation, fostering collaboration and skill development in alignment with **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17)**.
