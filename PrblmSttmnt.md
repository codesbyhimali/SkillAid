### Problem Statement:
 Many young people lack access to mentorship and skill-building opportunities, limiting their
 personal and professional growth, including entrepreneurial potential. Professionals, especially
 entrepreneurs, and board members of companies, often struggle to find platforms to connect
 with youth in need. Companies with CSR initiatives face challenges in finding impactful
 programs to support, hindering their ability to contribute to skill development and community
 engagement. Additionally, the absence of a system to track global partnerships for SDG 17
 reduces the effectiveness of collaboration in fostering sustainable entrepreneurship.
 
### Proposed Solution:
 SkillAid is a Volunteer-to-Learn platform connecting professionals, especially entrepreneurs,
 with youth for mentorship and skill-sharing. Youth can earn "SkillAid Credits" for volunteering,
 redeemable for educational resources or entrepreneurial training. This encourages
 entrepreneurial thinking and equips young people with the skills needed to start ventures.
 Companies can align their CSR initiatives with entrepreneurial development by sponsoring
 mentorship or boot camps, fostering cross-border collaboration for sustainable economic
 growth. A comprehensive dashboard will track global partnerships, providing transparent
 metrics on contributions to SDG 17.
 By combining volunteering, learning incentives, and entrepreneurial mentorship, SkillAid creates
 a global culture of service-driven education and sustainable entrepreneurship
